# Introduction-to-the-Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms

This repository holds all projects from my Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms class.

All 3 projects demonstrate the design and analysis of algorithms. [Project 1](CS_430_HW_0.pdf) includes the analysis of binary search on a 2D array. [Project 2](CS_430_HW_1.pdf) Demonstrates the design of a Greedy Algorithm. [Project 3](CS_430_Final_Project.pdf) includes the solution to a recurrence.
